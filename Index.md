### CPSC 120


* Lab 3 apart 1
  
  This was a great start to an introduction of coding about strings. It showed how to store variables into a string by using very helpful examples. An example was ingredients for a burger such as protein bread and condiments. 

* Lab 7 part 1
  
  This was one of my favorite labs since it involved formulas. I understood that we needed to make a formula in order to find the difference between two dates. We needed to input the ending month, day, and year and subtract it by the starting month, day, and year.

* Lab 7 part 2
  
  This is also an interesting lab section since it was about a card game, Blackjack. This made me look into and research how to play this game so that I could complete the assignment. I then wrote formulas to predict the Blackjack number.
